# CSE-3541-Lighting-Project-Lab-4
 Unity Lighting Practice and familiarization with PBR materials 

All of the room objects and lights are static, the white capsule in the main room is the transformable object that casts movable shadows. There are a total of 3 rooms with different lighting to be explored.

“Physically based rendering” materials simulate how a texture or material reacts to light similar to their comparable real-life material. It ensures objects look the way they’re supposed to in different environments.
